                            <li>In effort based pricing the project cost depends on the time spent and the resource

                            <li>This model is particularly useful where the projects are quite complex and are prone to
                                specification and design changes during the course of the project.</li>
                            <li>This model gives the customer greater flexibility in developing projects and changing
                                specifications based on requirements</li>

                        <strong>Milestone-based Billing</strong> <br>
                        When clients are concerned about the deliverables, which can be achieved for remote projects
                        with a new vendor, they can opt for milestone based payments which allows them to monitor
                        project progress and pay according to deliveries.

                        <strong>Dedicated Development Facility / Dedicated Resources</strong> <br>
                        A Dedicated facility is like an extension of the client’s own development center. In our
                        dedicated facility we offer the best skill sets, resources, flexibility and time-to-market
                        advantages to our clients at the same time taking all necessary efforts to protect their
                        Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). All rights to the IPR developed in the Development Facility
                        vests with the customer.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Clients can get continuous offshore support at low costs. Since a dedicated facility is long
                        term in nature, we train our teams on client requirements and processes so that they can deliver
                        better. The resources would be charged on a monthly retainer basis making the entire process all
                        the more simpler.
